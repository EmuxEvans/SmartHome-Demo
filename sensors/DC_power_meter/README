This is the Zephyr sensor app on the Arduino 101 to measure DC power of the
smart house. It uses two TI INA219 current sensor boards from Adafruit to
measure the DC power consumption of the house, and the power generated by
the solar panel.

TI INA current sensor board can be found here:
(https://www.adafruit.com/products/904)

The power values will be displayed on a Grove RGB LCD display (optional). Please
note that the display works at 5V and requires a pull-up circuit to function.

The values are also transferred to the home gateway via UART line. A USB FTDI
should be used to connect from the Arduino 101 board to the gateway.

The pins should be connected like this:
Arduino 101	|	USB FTDI cable
    RX		|	    TX
    TX		|	    RX
    GND		|	    GND

On the gateway, use the following script to read from the Arduino 101 sensor:
# node <SmartHome-Demo folder>/ocf-servers/js-servers/power-uart.js

In order to build the Zephyr app for the Arduino 101 board, first setup the
Zephyr dev environment following the guidance here.
https://wiki.zephyrproject.org/view/Arduino_101

In the app source folder, use the following command to build and flash the app
to Arduino 101 board:
$ make pristine && make BOARD=arduino_101_sss_factory
$ sudo dfu-util -a sensor_core -D outdir/zephyr.bin
