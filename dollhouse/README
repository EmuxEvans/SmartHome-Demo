To add a function callback, simply implement the javascript function that matches 
the name of the Sketchup node plus the event type. 

If the node name contains special characters, you will need to declare the function as follows:

window["this-is-_a Special name_click"] = function(intersect) {
}

Currently supported events:

_mouseout
_mousein
_mousemove
_click
_mouseup
_mousedown


NOTE: For mesh object naming to work, you can not use the default ColladaLoader.js (r71)
The following change was made from the default ColladaLoader:

...
                    } else {

					if ( geom.isLineStrip === true ) {

						mesh = new THREE.Line( geom );

					} else {

						mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geom, material );

					}
                    
                    mesh.name = node.name;
				}
...
