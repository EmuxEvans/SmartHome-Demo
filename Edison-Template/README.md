This folder contains templates for implementing OIC servers running on the
Edison board (it may be applicable to other Linux-based systems).

It contains a number of OIC devices (servers) located in sub-folders:
    gas: CO2 sensor
    fan: fan device, can be turned on/off
    motion: motion detection sensor
    solar: Smart Solar Panel device

*Add instructions on how to build these*

E.g.:
1 Install dev tools (inc. IoTivity dev package) on target
2 Transfer code to target
3 Run 'make' within the OIC server directory
4 Start the OIC server as follows:
	./ocserver

*To Be Sanitized*
